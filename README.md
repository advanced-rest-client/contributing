# Contributing to API and ARC Components

This includes Advanced REST Client, API Console, and other related products.

## Housekeeping

First of all thank you very much for your contribution to our projects. We are open source and community driven. However, it is very important to follow couple of simple rules when you create an issue report or send a pull request.

### Signing your commits

All components and applications requires signed commits in their status checks. We want to be sure that the code comes from the person that is introduced in the PR. Creating and adding a GPG signature for your commits is relatively easy. Check out this GitHub's guide: [Managing commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification)

### Create an issue report for PRs

We understand that this looks like adding more work but as stated at the beginning of this document, these components and projects are community driven and we want to allow everyone to take a part in the discussion. We do not expect an article about the the change. Just the simple use case description (when applicable) and solution description.

We do not expect eny specific format of an issue report. Treat it as yours. Write a description that help others to understand why the change is needed.

### Please, test your code

Tests are usually a huge pain because they often take at least the same amount of time as developing the feature. However, tests helps us to make sure the components work as intended. Also, when another developer makes changes to the component, tests make sure that your contribution is not accidentally altered or removed. So yes, write tests for your code.

## Documentation

Get familiar with API Components architecture by browsing documentation at [docs.apicomponents.dev](https://docs.apicomponents.dev/).

## Contributing source of truth

We recognize that many of the repositories in this organization has own contribution statements. If so, please, ignore it. It's time consuming to update all repositories to remove their contribution policies. This is the only relevant contribution policy for API and ARC components.
